# EAGLE

EAGLE is PCB design and electrical schematic software.

## ULP
User Language Programs (ULP) are scripts that are run from within EAGLE to accomplish tasks that would be tedious to do by hand or have to be repeated frequently.

## Installation
Place it anywhere and navigate to it via EAGLE or put it in the folder with all the other ULP inside the EAGLE installation in $EAGLE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY$\examples\ulps\examples

## Usage
Launch the script inside EAGLE via the ULP Button.
